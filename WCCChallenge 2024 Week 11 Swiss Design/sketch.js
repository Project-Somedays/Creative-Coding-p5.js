Title: #WCCChallenge - Swiss Design, hosted by @sableraph on Twitch.tv: https://www.twitch.tv/sableraph

Bauhaus design looks delightfully clean and simple to produce.
To put my own twist on it, I want to poke Walter Gropius, founder of the movement, for more ideas.
Turns out the wikipedia picture ALREADY has him in Charles Xavier power pose for ideas.
Also a good opportunity to learn about masking in p5.js
